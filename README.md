# BreakOut-Game-Clone
This project is a simple Breakout-style game written in C++ using SDL3 for graphics, input handling, and window management. The player controls a paddle to keep a ball in play and destroy all bricks on the screen.
The game features basic collision detection, time-based movement, and a classic game loop. SDL3 is used for rendering and events, while GLM handles vector mathematics. The project was created for educational purposes to practice 2D game development concepts and object-oriented programming in C++.
